A small game for small children

This game was created for the Kivy App Contest 2014.
It aims to educate small children (age 1-3) by training their motor skills
and their ability to recognize shapes.

Our goals for the game were:

* keep it simple and easy to use
* adding new level should be easy
* running on every device (mouse and touch inputs) and every screen size

This was our first ever App in Python (and Kivy).

=============
How to start:

We still need to start the app with: 
$ python2 main.py -f --size 0x0
because for some reason nothing else works (at least on linux)

How to add new levels:
