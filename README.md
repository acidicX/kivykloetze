=============
### A small game for small children

This game was created for the Kivy App Contest 2014
It aims to educate small children (up to six years of age)
by training their motor skills and their ability to recognize shapes.

Our goals were to create a simple game where new levels can be easily added.
This was our first ever App in Python (and Kivy).

=============
### How to start:

We still need to start the app with: 
$ python2 main.py -f --size 0x0
because for some reason nothing else works (at least on linux)

### How to add new levels:
